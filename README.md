## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I finally learned the correct way to use `clamp` for responsive typography.

```css
.four_card_feature_title{
  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 1vw + 1.188rem, 2.25rem);
}
```

### Continued development

Continued development on CSS Grid and responsive coding.

### Useful resources

- [Resource to Learn Use of Clamp](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/01/modern-fluid-typography-css-clamp/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand `clamp`. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
